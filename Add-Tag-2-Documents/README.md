# Add-Tag-2-Documents
A very functional but simple work-around for that macOS Problem "Can't tag local Documents folder : Error -8058"

Use:
1. Be sure you have a Backup from ~/Documents, i recomend easy and fast: "send to zip"
2. Download and save this Script anywhere in your Mac, give it "chmod +x addtag.sh" and 
3. Run it with "./addtag.sh"
4. The Script ask you for a Tag in the Folder "~/D". Go to Finder, add the Tag you need, then press any Key in terminal to continue to run the Script.
5. Now you have a Document folder with your Tag! Enjoy

Thanks to user3439894 that from Stack that inspired this Script!
